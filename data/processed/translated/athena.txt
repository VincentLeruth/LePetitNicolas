24 million tonnes of cow, goat and sheep milk - nearly 40 billion in turnover including more than 9 billion from export - 80,000 full-time equivalent jobs - an industry which innovates and represents 24 of all iaa r d expenditure - an industry present throughout the national and overseas territory panorama of agri-food industries 2021 estimate carried out on the basis of our work other sectors of the agri-food industry meat prepared dishes biscuits also present very significant and promising potential the current hydrogen market is around 1 mth2 year in France by 2050 according to mc kinsey and the fchju it should reach between 5 and 6 mth2 year the potential of the dairy sector is at least 3 mth2 year ---slide--- 9 athéna research confidential innovation significant and varied market traction we have requests for Quebec Belgium Portugal the dessert industry bread making and biscuits from large groups of start-up cooperatives we have tested and it works from French and foreign regional representatives ---slide--- 10 athéna research innovation confidential competition we are in competition with fossil fuels other methods of producing hydrogen are more complementary than competitive ---slide--- 11 athéna research innovation confidential the main players in other hydrogen sectors new version current energy mix steam reforming of fossil products steam reforming of fossil products with ccs electrolysis of water steam reforming of biomethane pyrolysis of biomass ---slide--- 12 athéna research innovation confidential our strategy of differentiation and deployment we differentiate ourselves from the competition mainly because - we use wastewater and waste which interests no one - they have a significant cost for manufacturers who wish to find more interesting solutions - we are capable of producing or saving 10 times more energy than what our process consumes our deployment will be rapid because - we will support the investment through SPVs and we will sell the finished products - the manufacturers each have several sites and above all the composition of the wastewater and waste are very close adoption on one site will lead to adoption on the others - we will also be able to reproduce the production units industrially mark of interest of an industrialist evaluation of the hydrogen power of the effluent in the laboratory carrying out tests on site with our 1 m3 demonstrator if necessary carrying out full-scale tests with our industrial pilot on the basis of these results the investment decision is taken the site is built a structured and calibrated industrial deployment ---slide--- 13 athéna research innovation confidential end of 2016 2017 2018 2019 2022 2023 2024 2025 poc pilots our roadmap overview deployment industrial objective 2040 -
