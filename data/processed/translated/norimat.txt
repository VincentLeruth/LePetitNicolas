reducing the environmental impact of their production processes in parallel to move forward in their approach 4 0 they understand the need to use digital twins to simulate anticipate make the right decisions and in the field of production of parts launch their manufacturing much more quickly it is in this framework that norimat industrializes the sintering technology fast sps field assisted sintering technology spark plasma sintering for the production of high performance parts often difficult or even impossible to achieve with traditional foundry and additive manufacturing technologies the company thus consolidates its place as a major player in the dynamic ecosystem of advanced materials and processes however greater mastery of the technology on the part of users appears necessary to massively introduce fast sps into industries in demand for technical innovation economy resilience and sustainability this wide penetration of the technology passes in particular through two essential points the digitalization of the technology allowing in particular the control of the physical behaviors of the materials during the process the possibility of obtaining parts of complex shapes without machining but no technology on the market today is able to offer such possibilities with the combination of a unique offer covering the entire value chain norimat provides the necessary bricks to transform the entire fast sps sintering sector thus opening the way to hybrid production combining sps additive manufacturing and modeling ---slide--- confidential fast sps sintering 3 fast sps sintering is a manufacturing technique which uses powders which are compressed in a graphite mold and subjected to short electrical pulses of high intensity pulsed current this heating technology allows exceptional speeds of temperature rise up to 100 c min with great control of thermal gradients the action of pressure and heat consolidates the material under their effect the material densifies and forms a compact part the speed of the sintering cycle leads to materials without defects and made up of a very fine microstructure giving them very high performances p p powder electrode
