strong context of reduction of the carbon impact requires the existence of efficient means of production which are sustainable and whose maintenance over time is carried out at controlled cost observations however in wind power numerous issues make the management of parks still very complicated 3 energy efficiency better adjust the aerodynamic profile of the blades reduce downtime in the event of icing in particular risk management improve preventive maintenance reduce wear on equipment better protect the blades normative meet regulatory requirements environmental reduce noise pollution ---slide--- problems wind electricity producers currently have poorly developed means to manage these constraints, for example to adjust the angle of incidence of the blades 4 they measure the speed of the wind at a single point which does not make it possible to understand the real flow of air along the blade they position an anemometer device allowing the speed or pressure of the wind to be measured at the rear or at the top of the blade mast each time the measurement turns out to be of poor quality consequences 60 of the wind turbines are misaligned in relation to the wind and 25 suffer from an imbalance of the rotor source epsiline the observation is the same when we talk about frost since a turbine without a detection system can suffer from a drop in annual production of up to 10 source eologix ---slide--- our ambition 5 to provide operators with a complete solution to improve the energy and environmental performance of industrial equipment thanks to the use of data created in continuously optimize the adjustment of the aerodynamics of the blades in real time improve the structural monitoring of a wind farm strengthen preventive maintenance and risk management

use of drones depending on the case real-time data generation radio receiver included in the device analysis calculator included in the device diagnosis carried out corrections repairs automatic corrections maintenance to be planned by the manager ---slide--- by positioning our sensors and electronic spurs directly on the blades we obtain information at several points which, after analysis, makes it possible to improve the energy and environmental performance of industrial equipment bladesense has developed several devices allowing the creation and analysis of data for continuous and real-time monitoring of an off-shore or onshore wind blade our innovation for the benefit of wind power 8 definition the pole is a small weather vane or banner attached to the sails or in the rigging to indicate the direction of the wind ---slide--- advantage competitive 9 the interest of the aero device compared to existing sensors in comparison with existing measurement technologies the epenon aero will provide fundamentally different information that of the state of the flow on the profile and not that of the speed of the flow moreover the epenon will make it possible to automatically check and correct the adjustment of the incidence of a wind blade better adjusting the aerodynamic profile makes it possible to increase production but also to reduce fatigue and therefore maintenance costs ---slide--- what else is relevant our solution aéro offers a real measurement at sea or on land, dynamic and in real time, of the air flow along the unique blades, no other sensor allows this type of diagnosis and therefore to act for increased productivity of wind turbines complete our offer makes it possible to meet the major needs of wind farm operators protection monitoring operational

the challenges are therefore considerable in view of the global wind power capacity of 743 gw in 2020 for comparison a capacity of 1 gw corresponds to that of 1 nuclear power plant or 1 large coal power plant the environmental impact 12 stated objective of bladesense energy efficiency thanks to our solutions the estimated production gain of a correctly adjusted wind turbine is from 1 to 4 ---slide--- namely the sector makes it possible to avoid the release into the atmosphere of 1 each year 1 billion tonnes of co2 it already represents the clean technology which offers the greatest potential for decarbonization per MW of energy produced according to forecasts 469 GW of capacity should still be installed over the next 5 years onshore wind power remains the main technology driven by cost reduction it has become one of the cheapest energy sources in the world offshore is experiencing particularly strong growth the average cost excluding subsidies of this energy is also constantly falling a market in strong growth throughout the world the sector of wind power 13 cumulative capacity of global wind power production in gw source gwec it should be noted that bladesense solutions can be adapted to any type of existing wind turbine ---slide--- europe now has a wind farm of 205 gw including 183 gw onshore and 22 gw offshore in terms of consumption wind energy already represents 15 of the electricity consumed by the eu-28 the european wind industry represents 300 000 workers 36 billion GDP and 8 billion exports this positive trend that wind power is experiencing in Europe allows a real rise in power of this renewable energy which is fully in line with the objectives set by the European green deal sources businessfrance and gwec the wind power market in 2020 14 ---slide--- reminder of the objectives of the law relating to the energy transition for green growth promulgated on August 17, 2015 increase the share of renewable energies at 33 of the gross final energy consumption in 2030 reach 40 of the production of electricity from renewable sources in 2030 with regard to the means of this policy the budget for 2021 provides 5.68 billion in support of renewable electrical energies, i.e. 900 million more than the previous year this French policy recently reinforced by the France 2030 plan is part of a European framework of support for the electricity production of renewable origin a very favorable political framework making Europe the first continent for renewable energy with a level of net zero greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 is a challenge that wind power is ready to take on with a supply chain present throughout the continent allowing mastery of technologies and greater energy independence the European commission is committed to strengthening wind power on the high seas this is what emerges from a plan presented by the commission on November 18, 2020 the project plans to multiply by 25 the production of wind energy by 2050 to do this a vast network of wind turbines would be installed in the North Sea and in the Baltic in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean to reach a production capacity of 300 gw compared to 22 gw for
