10x faster material process optimization powered by ml bomp app ---slide--- why industrial r d fails to deliver fast enough trial-and-error loops optimization cycles take months e g 6 12 hr feedback loops hundreds of runs sparse messy data real datasets are small and heterogeneous traditional tools require 1 000 rows to work one metric at a time existing methods only optimize a single parameter forcing costly rework when priorities shift rising sustainability regulation pressure new materials and processes must be tested faster but today s approaches can t keep pace r d teams waste months developing and optimizing materials and processes for new products ---slide--- transforming how industry develops materials and processes replaces trial-and-error with guided learning shortens r d cycles by 3-5x saving up to 70 costs explainable recommendations provides transparent and explainable results for direct implementation multi-objective by design bomp optimizes all parameters at once - 60 80 fewer iterations than single- objective small data - big results optimizes from heterogeneous sparse datasets with 15 100 rows vs 1 000 for conventional tools ---slide--- market opportunity tam global ai optimization 113 b sam global ai optimization in target industries 14 b som european focus 30 m advanced materials composites polymers rubber metals plastics process industries pulp chemicals pharmaceuticals energy sustainability optimization of hvac energy grids process efficiency manufacturing process optimization factory automation smart manufacturing industry cagr ca 40 ---slide--- competition low cost rapid multi- objective optimization slow single- objective optimization high cost ---slide--- the diverse core team isaac miranda cto phd in engineering physics background in material selection engineering and optimization juha koivisto research fellow with phd in applied physics expert in machine learning oriented to materials discovery mikko alava professor at aalto university for 15 years more than 200 published articles more than 40 in high impact journals markus holmstr m cco msc in strategic business development 10 years of exp with deep tech innovations in materials and energy sectors as a founder consultant c-level pamela ngui ceo mba in creative sustainability multi- disciplinary background advisors kourosh mobredi head of engineering phd in applied physics strong background with complex material and algorithm development ---slide--- how we are going to make money cloud-to-enterprise model with built-in upsell 1 user up to 10 users enterprise 1 000 year 7 500 year on request expand saas upsell seat expansion premium features training increases acv 2 5 scale on-prem enterprise 25k 250k annual licence production-grade sticky deployments validated in pilots cloud for r d on-prem for production this dual model maximizes adoption and long-term arr ---slide--- go-to-market strategy currently we are research-to-business r2b at aalto university and we do test pilots for validating the performance and securing lois r d units in mid-to-large enterprises already engaged early 2026 bomp will incorporate and is revenue-ready from day 1 in the eu market 2025 r2b grant-funded 2026 seed eur 1 5m 2028 series a scaling 2027 series a prep validate technology via 8-10 pilots secure lois in pulp paper composites semiconductors deliver tech validated trl5 customer intent ready to sell incorporate core tech sales team land 5-7 lighthouse clients in pulp composite semiconductors target eur 200k arr pipeline eur 500k expand through integration partners mes erp players consultancies focus on multi-site enterprise deals upsell enterprise licenses 50- 250k acv team expansion 15 enter apac us market expand partner ecosystem with automation partners arr target eur 2-3m ---slide--- 10 industry pilots completed before incorporation proven roi across several industries materials composites viable recipes from 20 30 samples vs hundreds pulp paper reduced bleaching cycles from several months to weeks semiconductors optimized complex wafer polishing parameters sustainable plastics months of wasted manual reformulation eliminated adoption signals interest in white-label licensing from industry leaders several companies ready to convert pilots into paid licenses -
