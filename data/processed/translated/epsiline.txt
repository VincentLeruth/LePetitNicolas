measure in front of the blades the epsiline lidar allows this thanks to its remote measurement 29 the wind turbines are controlled by sonic anemometers located behind the blades the measurements are disturbed by the turbulence generated by these blades and are by nature erroneous despite sophisticated software to correct them sereema solution provides a partial and imprecise response because it

anemometers which measure behind the blades are unprecise and do not allow optimal control of the wind turbine windesco offers tools based mainly on wind turbine data which results in great

reliable solution is to measure in front of the blades but the solution must be easy to install competition vs romowind 1 2 epsiline easy installation possible by the customer the solution provided by romowind measures in front of the blades where it is most precise like windeagle but the installation requires entering the hub or nose of the wind turbine with teams who have unusual authorizations therefore very limited number of teams in addition the angle between the three parts of this instrument must be achieved with great precision otherwise the measurement is totally disturbed this severely limits the ability of the customer to install this solution the owner-operator of the wind farm must call on romowind to come and install the solution the windeagle is easy to install the

with anemometers which do not allow precise measurement measurement behind the blades optimization software are offered by the turbine manufacturer himself - conflict of interest in addition the software is a black box the owner- operator does not know exactly what is optimized finally it is not possible to measure the gain precisely with scada data from the wind turbine competition vs software from oems epsiline easy installation possible by the customer example characterization of the siemens-gamesa tcup software by epsiline in this study the operator has to use the windeagle
