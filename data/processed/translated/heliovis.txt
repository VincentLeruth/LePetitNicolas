million to develop a smart solar thermal technology specifically designed for cost reductions capex and opex scale economies and for harsh climate conditions the core of the technology is an inflatable tube-shaped solar collector heliotube made of three industry-proven plastic films with a length of 220 m an aperture of 7 8 m and a thermal power of 0 9 mwpthdriving down capex by -55 and opex by -20 compared to state-of-the-art parabolic trough systems due to its unique cost structure the scalable heliotube produces clean solar thermal energy industrial heat in a temperature range of 90 c to 550 c for up to 24 hours per day at highly competitive and stable price levels this represents a clear usp vs competing solar technologies and opens up huge global markets barred to all solar competitors the cost structure enables commercially viable direct applications of the solar thermal energy especially for i solar water desalination and brine treatment ii co2 reduction in the oil gas industry iii solar heat for industrial processes ship iv solar thermal cooling and v the reduction of fuel costs in combined heat and power chp plants with the first full-scale industrial application

field and stored in thermal energy storage tanks before it is directed towards a heat exchanger he where it produces steam the htf runs through a closed loop and flows back to the solar field where it is re- heated the technology can also be used as a pre-heater factories can benefit from solar heat for indu strial processes ship and also from electricity generated by steam turbines ship is ideally suited to serve applications in the low and medium temperature range between 90 and 350 c where 59 of the global industrial heat demand 783 twh is set in central europe where industrial process heat is typically produced in chp plants the technology helps save fuel costs on sunny days when electricity prices are low on such days the technology provides an alternative source of thermal energy

12 application 5 district heating in combination with chp plants the heat for most district heating grids and many industrial off-takers in central europe is produced in combined heat and power chp plants they make efficient use of primary energies and produce heat and power at the same time on sunny days electricity prices drop sharply due to a surplus of power generated by pv plants this effect is projected to increase in the future and power prices around or even below zero are expected whenever generation from pv panels spikes for chp plants this results in negative margins on sunny days especially if biofuels are used which are relatively cost intensive in this situation heliotubes can support existing chp plants by providing an alternative source of thermal energy this allows chp plants to be operated at lower capacities or fully turned off saving fuel and avoiding negative power prices ---slide--- heliovis ag iz n -s d street 2d unit m16 2351 wiener neudorf austria eu www
