leo is better oq tech geo competitors reliability service availability leo constellations is composed of large number of satellites and failure of small number of satellites does not interrupt the service and satellites can be easily geo satellites cover large footprint of earth and failure of 1 satellites leads to huge service inavailability and it is very expensive and slow to replace geo satellites e g this year viasat inmarsat lost 2 geo satellites leading to massive coverage and subscribers loss state of the art technology agility smallsat with a lifetime of 5 years and lead time less than 1 year allowing new technologies or hw upgrades to be immediately deployed in the network geo have a lifetime of 15 years and a lead time of min 3 years technology is outdated before the satellite is launched the qa process is very long and rigorous and costly the components are expensive due to the high radiation on outer belts this leads to an astronomical cost 250 million of a geo satellite and a launch of 150 million which is not comparable to a leo microsatellite 650k gateways hardware low-cost gateways and flexible locations expensive gateways located at fixed locations which are defined by the design of the satellite gateways frequencies s-band spectrum safe from external threat generally operated in c-band ku-band or ka-band those frequencies are potentially at risk because of mobile services taking over gateways flexibility possibility to add customer-owned gateways at any locations impossible to add a gateway after the satellite is launched designed depending on the satellite design the gateway might not even be in the country up scalability affordability possibility to increase capacity by adding new satellites as the demand increases operational costs geo are designed for 15-yr lifetime and satellite capacity has to be sized according the 15-yr market forecast mission likely to be over specified and so service overpriced for the first several years of operation spectrum coordination small beams means finer and easier coordination leo constellations are dynamic and use multiple orbital planes with small footprints which makes it possible to coordinate spectrum access apply spectrum re-use for same beam and bandwidth and mitigate interference even with thousands of satellites radio frequency goes beyond borders large beams at risk of shutting down if a country complains hence putting the whole beam off all geo satellites are congested in one orbit 36 000 km and each operator has historically occupied slots and frequencies to change that or introduce new frequency bands requires very long and tedious coordination process which can take up to 7 years to manage the slots and interference since most geo arc satellites will see the interference due to the large footprint and sometimes operators has no option but to split the spectrum which limits the capacity ---slide--- copyright 2021 by oq technology s r l all rights reserved 42 leo vs geo cont oq tech geo competitors spectrum certainty operates licensed spectrum with own notified itu filings quite often spectrum is accessed through commercial agreement with large operators if the contract is not renewed or price drastically increased this might dramatic commercial impacts security jamming interference leo have small beams and are moving difficult to jam intercept also interference is managed due to small footprint but also the hopping and digital signal processing capability on software radio payloads and upgrading algorithms continuously geo have large beams and stay fixed easy to intercept jam - geo satellites suffer from interference due to the large footprint on earth and also from neighboring geo satellites but most importantly from other leo satellites e g risk for astrocast and thuraya for geo to operate properly the margins have to be high meaning high power equipment and dishes and also exclusivity to their bandwidth in-orbit upgrades processin g leo smallsat payloads are using advanced software defined radios which can be upgraded with new software in orbit including future 5g broadband or 6g technologies or any other update giving great flexibility and high processing capability geo satellites are bent pipe old architecture with limited possibility to implement software defined radio or high processing capability for the signals due to the lack of radiation hardened components or expensive qualification needed for a software radio payload in the geo orbit which includes high levels of of protons and radiation and cosmic ray within the outer van allen belts including meo orbits too weather effect s band is resistive to rain and weather conditions also no pointing is needed and hence antennas not affected by wind geo bands especially ka are very sensitive to rain and weather clouds also satellite dishes are prone to loss of signal due to movement or wind due to the high accuracy pointing requirement towards the geo arc launch opportunities leo satellites has a breadth of available launchers and launch windows since it is easier and cheaper to launch into leo orbit 87 companies globally gto launch the path to go to geo is very expensive with only handful of large launch providers offering limited slots per year to go to that orbit ---slide--- copyright 2021 by oq
