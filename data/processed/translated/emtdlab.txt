emtdlab space division revolutionizing space radiation shielding with a i investment pitch deck updated september 2024 version 14 author cedric r g thiry ceo ---slide--- one of the major challenges the space industry faces is the high amounts of particle radiation in their missions not only harmful for living organisms high levels of radiation 130x higher than that found on earth naturally also affects the performance of satellites and the underlying it systems microchips processors lifespan and performance are greatly reduced causing large disruptions replacement costs and complexity satellite operators and their clients are constantly struggling to protect the most valuable components the microchips and processors from the high levels of radiation through costly and inadequate protective shields current shields are even not prepared to protect advanced processors from unexpected flares of cosmic radiation cfr articles causing billions of usd in losses emtdlab pitch deck q4 2023 p 2 high radiation levels in space significantly impact satellite performance and lifespan ---slide--- emtdlab is focused to create a class of new materials capable of being an effective shield against radiation like the concept of natural selection found in nature emtdlab targets an initial population of materials make small changes to it then tests it against radiation following the results the best attributes of the material are kept and the weakest are discarded this process is accelerated by symade ai emtdlab s patented ai platform symade ai digitally simulates billions of new materials and for each material it digitally runs experiments through its natural selection process for each material the system repeats the process by interchanging attributes or adding new attributes until an optimal solution is found the result is the fittest material built by a certified ai algorithm digitally tested billions of times and verifiable by space agencies emtdlab pitch deck q4 2023 p 3 current radiation shields are costly and insufficient for protecting advanced processors ---slide--- our technology is lightweight flexible and affordable it can be applied to any type of system regardless of its size or shape our technology can protect any space system from radiation damage and extend its lifespan and functionality emtdlab pitch deck q4 2023 p 4 1 product

q4 2023 p 13 august 2024 emtdlab s symade a i software has reached an important milestone the first radiation shielding materials discovery campaign after defining the chemical space consisting of chosen chemical elements of the periodic table the software can generate a population of simulated materials more specifically alloys and evolve this population over time for each alloy it can accurately estimate its density stability and predict its radiation shielding properties we observe that the software can independently explore the predefined chemical space and that the evolved materials are getting better over time with respect to their shielding performance we ve already managed to discover a set of metal alloys candidates emtdlab is currently planning the metal alloys
