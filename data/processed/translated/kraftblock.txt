1 pioneering high temperature thermal storage grid-resilient cost-competitive solution for industrial heat october 2025 ---slide--- the industrial heat sector is a huge market needing decarbonisation kraftblock s modular thermal energy storage tes platform provides a solution to resilience and to decarbonize the industrial heat demand kraftblock s market potential includes electrification and waste heat recovery projects leading to an annual market potential of more than 160 billion in 20261 for heat demand 100 estimate for europe is at least 25 of this heat is different 1 following a
