---slide--- the pain medicine old laser technologies with high after surgery pain and scarring industry low laser power and slow laser speeds in welding leading to high risk of thermal degradation or material disintegration agriculture slow manual techniques and expensive chemical weed controlling techniques which are toxic to humans wildlife and the environment problems with the old limited optical laser power insufficient laser speeds --- limited productivity low power output and efficiencies no frequency stabilization and tunability of high powered lasers high sensitivity to back reflection limited efficiency when used outdoors ---slide--- current market systems futonics uses the excitation at 793nm and technology that uses the up-conversion process in thulium resulting in almost twice the energy efficiency compared to ipg technology a new concept for laser co2 and holium lasers operate in the medium ir wavelength range but are often bulky and energy inefficient many companies building fiber lasers but few build at the 2 m wavelength only ipg photonics is produces a 200w laser at 2 m wavelength but uses an outmoded laser concept for pumping exciting the thulium-fiber their technology is derived from pumping the ytterbium-laser which then excites the erbium-laser which then excites the thulium-laser - which is very inefficient and prone to failure

67billion in 2027 at a cagr of 7 from 2019 the eu is phasing out glyphosate a widely used herbicide with luxemburg completely banning all products containing glyphosate due to its carcinogenic and genotoxic side effects the industrial laser market is forecasted to grow to 13 28billion in 2027 from 5 17billion in 2019 at a cagr of 12 4 the appeal of fiber laser for industrial cutting welding and drilling is rising due to high reliability easy computer and robotic automation integration the medical laser market is anticipated to grow to 10 7billion in 2027 from 3 11billion in 2020 at a cagr of 19 3 rising focus on physical appearance is increasing preference for minimally non-invasive procedures surgery using medical lasers generally results in less pain minimal incisions reduced risk of post-procedural complications ---slide--- go-to-market strategy higher volume production will take three to four years during this time our strategic partners customers need to validate the systems
