knowledge data ai app explainable knowledge deterministically written knowledge by an engineer generative engineering exhaustive generation from explainable knowledge data generation of the set of all possible solutions statistical ai unexplainable knowledge x x ai app by employing generative engineering algorithms the ai app automates engineering tasks and presents a wide range of scenarios x engineer jobs can be summarized by two elements their knowledge and what they produce with it rely on engineering knowledge generation of all admissible solutions generated data available data
