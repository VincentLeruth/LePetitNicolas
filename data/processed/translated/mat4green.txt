round we can immediately deploy our technology with lt metal and begin selling to our serviceable obtainable market without additional capex the global ito market reached 2b in 2024 through our partnership with lt metal the world s second-largest ito producer m4gt s licensable technology is positioned within the largest ito manufacturing region validating our relevance across the entire market the ito market outside mainland china represents 1 2b by licensing our process to regional producers m4gt can expand rapidly without capital constraints as new licensees adopt the technology we can capture a larger share of the sam reaching multiple geographies and customer segments through local partners the immediate obtainable market is valued at 360m with existing lois sales and a strategic licensing partnership with lt metal the world s second-largest ito producer m4gt is ready to scale its licensing model and begin capturing global market share immediately after this funding round positioned to capture 300m market post-financing driving growth through immediate market access and strong partnerships 5 ---slide--- industrial validation with lt metal proven low cost low

combines recycled and virgin materials in one closed-loop process current methods treat recycling and production separately causing material loss and inefficiency low-temperature energy-efficient process our proprietary process operates at significantly lower temperatures cutting energy use and co emissions compared to conventional high- heat processes high material yield and recovery m4gt achieves near complete utilization of indium and tin minimizing waste traditional routes lose up to 30 40 of valuable material simplified pr ocess flow fewer production steps and optimized powder handling reduce labor and utility needs enabling lower production costs and higher margins scalable and factory-ready design the modular machine design allows seamless integration into existing facilities enabling rapid global rollout through licensing ---slide--- building a strong and strategic ipr foundation m4gt exclusively owns all intellectual property and full rights to its developed production process a comprehensive freedom-to-operate fto analysis by rouse confirmed approval and a unique protected market position the process and associated expertise are currently safeguarded through ndas and strict confidentiality measures as part of this investment round m4gt will initiate patent filings for its process and know-how patent applications will cover key innovations including the atomization chamber design dual-zone powder collection system and leaching process this strategic ip approach protects the technology while keeping the complete process undisclosed to competitors m4gt owns its proprietary ito process backed by fto validation upcoming patents will secure key innovations while keeping the full process confidential 10 ---slide--- 10 letters of intent
