digitalization of intralogistics is a multi billion euros market opportunity intralogistics is an essential component in the world-wide economic fabric e-commerce is boosting growth intralogistics relies heavily on labor for simple moving-good tasks 40 of the cost intralogistics faces two challenges slim net profit margins 2 1 low wages and therefore shortage of personnel to address swelling demand technology that reduces this reliance on simple labor has 2 key benefits boost of net profit boost of revenue 1 csimarket 2 there are 10 million mhe vehicles at an asp of 1 800 euros for a digital solution as presented below this represents 18 billion euros digital technology that reduces the reliance of intralogistics on labor represents a multi billion euros market opportunity 2 56 7

awareness prevent incidents how to prevent collisions between vehicles and or persons during my watch how to prevent rack collapse during my watch how to prevent unsafe behavior that sooner or later leads to damages and down-time knowing the exact location and speed of vehicles prevents incidents no more scanning how to prevent production stop due to missing items how to prevent shipping wrong goods how to boost inventory accuracy how to find pallets without labelling scanning knowing the exact locations of vehicles renders barcode scanning obsolete optimize operations what is happening during the night weekend activity benchmarking do we have too many vehicles do we have the right mix of long term vs short term lease analysis of what is happening where enables actionable insights to
