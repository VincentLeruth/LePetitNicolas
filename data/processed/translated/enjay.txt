the energy company of a new era 100 fossil-free energy 50 lower energy costs no investment required ---slide--- - industrial heat makes up two-thirds of industrial energy demand and almost one-fifth of global energy consumption - industry accounts for roughly 30 of global energy use and - 20 50 of that energy is used only once and subsequently lost as waste heat most of this waste heat literally goes up the exhaust stack vented out through industrial ventilation systems because - the exhaust air is laden with particles and pollutants which means - conventional heat recovery equipment fails this creates three major problems the problem - waste heat waste heat recovery basics department of energy 1 lost profitability instead of reusing the energy companies must draw new energy from the grid losing out on massive potential savings in operational energy costs 2 unnecessary emissions industries burn additional fossil fuels they could otherwise avoid missing a major opportunity to cut scope 1 emissions at the source 3 society bears the cost of systemic inefficiencies because industries waste recoverable energy we must build more power plants and expand the grid unnecessarily clean and efficient heat for industry iea international energy agency ---slide--- - enjay s breakthrough technology changes that unlocking waste heat as a new renewable power source waste heat power - waste heat power stands apart it is generated right where it s needed it s 100 renewable and it s far cheaper than grid energy - mckinsey published a report in 2023 exploring how much waste heat is available for recovery with existing technology the result is staggering and in the chart to the right the waste heat power potential is shown in comparison to the 2024 annual global renewable energy generation the solution - waste heat power - waste heat power used to have limited economical value prior to the 2021 energy crisis - the new normal energy prices in post-energy-crisis europe means double natural gas cost doubled value of waste heat power - with the historically low value there was no incentive for the required groundbreaking new technology development why waste heat has remained an unused energy source ---slide--- market size waste heat power potential is immense currently larger than all the nuclear power generated globally while enjay s technology is not universally applicable to all waste heat sources its targeted applications address high value opportunities given the young nature of this market we complement limited historical data with customer modeling and industry insights to quantify potential one 1 tunnel oven 235 k mondelez 350 ovens 82 m top 100 food industry giants 2 18 of top 100 top 100 food giants 3 7 b other industries bottom-up potential derivasion -
