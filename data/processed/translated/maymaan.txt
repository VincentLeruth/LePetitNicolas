mission vision what tesla did for batteries maymaan will do for internal combustion engines mission vision ---slide--- despite global urgency combustion engines remain dirty outdated and deeply embedded in industrial infrastructure current green solutions fall short either too expensive too complex or too incompatible to scale where power is needed most high emissions traditional diesel engines emit massive amounts of co no and particulates over 2 billion tons of co annually pollution cost diesel use is both polluting and costly fuel waste emissions penalties and climate regulations are driving up operational expenses non scalable alternatives most green options like hydrogen and electrification are too costly or complex for off-grid use mainly due to lacking infrastructure for economically unviable technologies 03 the world runs on dirty fuel https www csiro au en news all articles 2024 november global-carbon-emissions-up-2024 ---slide--- maymaan aquastroke technology a
